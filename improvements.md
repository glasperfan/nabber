# Ways to improve Nabber	

## For a student
* Be able to download from Canvas successfully.
	* They're not regular links. It's part of Canvas' API. The href looks something like https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/6017/files/1049452/download?wrap=1. It just needs to be clicked on for download.

## For a frequent user
* Make sure it's optimized for large number of photos or files on a page.

## General
* Add a link to personal website over my name in the popup.
* Prettier CSS?
* Eliminate duplicates (__IMPORTANT__)
* Shorten long names or find some way to deal with them
* Add hover link to preview the image being downloaded
* Remove images or photos section if there are none?
* Use alt attribute for image name where possible!
