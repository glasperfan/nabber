# Nabber

Nabber is a Chrome extension to download images from a website. 
This is my first Chrome extension (of hopefully many more), so please let me know if you have any feedback!

##Functionality
When you click on the hand icon in the address bar, Chrome will automatically download all images on the current page 
using the original file names.   

## Versioning
* Version 0.0.1: Main infrastructure in place, ability to downloads all images on click.
* Version 0.5.0: (__in progress__) add popup to allow user to select which images to download.
* Version 0.5.5: (_upcoming_) fix contentSettings to remove warning about multiple downloads.
